# Hungry Animal Tutorial
You are a hungry elephant that needs to keep eating apples to stay alive. Collect the falling apples to gain score and try to stay alive for as long as possible. Hitting a spike trap or failing to eat an apple will result in a game over.

**New Features Added**

1. Going past the world boundaries will automatically teleport you to the other side
     e.g. Holding left will teleport you to the right side

2. Spikes will appear with 1.5 seconds of warning before collision is enabled. They will last for 2.5 seconds before disappearing and touching them will result in a game over. Every 5 points, an additional spike trap will appear.

3. A high score value is saved as long as it is the same play session.

4. Pressing "w" will allow the elephant to jump

5. Pressing "r" will reset the game but keep the high score value
